A stream buffer represents the actual series of bytes that the program executes.

Code
public Length { get; set; } -> ushort
	This represents the total length of the stream buffer.

public ReadIDENTIFIER(ushort) -> TYPE
	These series of methods allow you to read a specific type value at a specific position.

public WriteIDENTIFIER(TYPE) -> void
	These series of methods allow you to write a specific type value to the stream buffer.
